    """Data class for handling Huang 1980 PET data.

    This class extends TissueData to provide specific functionality for processing and analyzing
    PET data according to the Huang 1980 model. It handles data loading, measurement adjustments,
    and provides access to volume of distribution (v1) measurements.

    Args:
        context: The analysis context object containing configuration and utilities
        data_dict (dict, optional): Dictionary containing input data. Defaults to empty dict.

    Attributes:
        v1 (NDArray): Volume of distribution measurements as a numpy array
        v1_measurement (dict): Raw volume of distribution measurements with metadata

    Note:
        When using RadialArtery input function type, v1 measurements are automatically
        adjusted using the recovery coefficient.
