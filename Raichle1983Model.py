    The Raichle1983Model class is a subclass of the TCModel class that implements the signal model proposed by Raichle et al. in 1983.

    Args:
        input_function (function): The input function that describes the tracer kinetics.
        pet_measurement (dict): The PET measurement data.
        truths (dict, optional): The ground truth values for the parameters. Defaults to None.
        home (str, optional): The HOME directory. Defaults to the current working directory.
        sample (str, optional): The sampling method. Defaults to "rslice".
        nlive (int, optional): The number of live points for sampling. Defaults to 1000.
        rstate (numpy.random.Generator, optional): The random state. Defaults to np.random.default_rng(916301).
        tag (str, optional): A tag for identification. Defaults to "".
