class IOInterface(ABC):
    """Abstract interface class for filesystem I/O operations.

    This class defines the interface for file system input/output operations used across
    the PET data analysis pipeline. It provides abstract methods that must be implemented
    by concrete subclasses to handle various I/O tasks.

    The interface includes methods for:
        - Loading and saving NIfTI files and associated metadata
        - Extracting timing information from data dictionaries
        - File path manipulation and validation
        - Data interpolation and time series operations

    Attributes:
        fqfp: Fully qualified file prefix property
        results_fqfp: Results file prefix property

    Note:
        This is an abstract base class that cannot be instantiated directly.
        Concrete implementations must override all abstract methods.
