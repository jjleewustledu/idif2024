class TissueContext(DynestyContext):
    """Base context class for tissue model implementations.

    This class provides the base context for analyzing PET data using various tissue models.
    It coordinates the data handling, solver, I/O operations, and plotting functionality
    common across different tissue model implementations.

    Args:
        data_dict (dict): Dictionary containing input data including:
            - input_func_fqfn (str): Fully qualified filename for input function data
            - tissue_fqfn (str): Fully qualified filename for tissue data

    Attributes:
        io (TissueIO): I/O handler for tissue data
        plotting (TissuePlotting): Plotting utilities for tissue data
        input_func_type (str): Type of input function used

    Example:
        >>> data = {"input_func_fqfn": "input.csv", "tissue_fqfn": "tissue.csv"}
        >>> context = TissueContext(data)
        >>> context.io.load_data()
        >>> context.plotting.plot_results()

    Notes:
        This is an abstract base class that should be inherited by specific tissue model
        implementations like Mintun1984Context or Raichle1983Context.
        
        Requires all incoming PET and input function data to be decay corrected.
