    """Data class for handling Mintun 1984 PET data.

    This class extends TissueData to provide specific functionality for processing and analyzing
    PET data according to the Mintun 1984 model. It handles data loading, measurement adjustments,
    and provides access to volume of distribution (v1) and binding site density (ks) measurements.

    Args:
        context: The analysis context object containing configuration and utilities
        data_dict (dict, optional): Dictionary containing input data. Defaults to empty dict.
            Required keys:
                - v1_fqfn: Fully qualified filename for v1 measurements
                - ks_fqfn: Fully qualified filename for ks measurements

    Attributes:
        v1 (NDArray): Volume of distribution measurements as a numpy array
        v1_measurement (dict): Raw volume of distribution measurements with metadata
        ks (NDArray): Binding site density measurements as a numpy array
        ks_measurement (dict): Raw binding site density measurements with metadata

    Note:
        When using RadialArtery input function type, v1 measurements are automatically
        adjusted using the recovery coefficient.
